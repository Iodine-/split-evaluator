## 1.2.2 (September 13, 2017)

Note: On this version we will start adding the patch version to the docker image tag,
so it will be 1.2.2 and of course, it will be in sync with callhome.

* Updating SDK version to v9.3.5 which is the latest stable to the date.

## 1.2.1 (September 8, 2017)

* Added `/machine/` endpoint.
  ```{
    ip: {ip_address},
    name: {machine_name}
  }```

## 1.2.0 (September 7, 2017)
Note: We are using 1.2.0 to start in order to match the version of the 
docker image on Docker Hub, which is currently 1.2. From now on we will have those
versions in sync.

* Updating SDK version to v9.3.4 which is the latest stable to the date.
* Updated README.md. 
* Added NEWS.txt, CHANGES.txt and LICENSE files. 
* Removed docker-hub support.
* Making SPLITIO_EXT_API_KEY header optional. If it is not set, it won't be required.
* Adding some logs and errors for better debugging.
* Modifying `/get-treatment` response to return the `splitName` field. 
  ```{
    "splitName": "my-experiment",
    "treatment": "on"
  }```
* Modifying `/get-treatments` endpoint to receive an array of keys and return only feature flags for
  the traffic types on which a key was provided.
  Example curl: curl 'http://localhost:4444/get-treatments?keys=\[\{"matchingKey":"my-first-key","trafficType":"account"\},\{"matchingKey":"my-second-key","bucketingKey":"my-bucketing-key","trafficType":"user"\}\]' -H 'Authorization: {SPLITIO_EXT_API_KEY}'
* Modifying `/get-treatments` response to be an array of the objects returned on get-treatment.
  ```[
    { "splitName": "my-experiment", "treatment":"on" },
    { "splitName": "my-second-experiment", "treatment":"off" },
    ...
    { "splitName": "my-last-experiment", "treatment":"visa" }
  ]```
* Modified `/version` response.
  ```{
    version: {callhome_version},
    sdk: {sdk_language},
    sdkVersion: {sdk_version_number}
  }```
